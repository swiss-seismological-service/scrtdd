                        the next time the profile is loaded (they will be read again from the configured

                        to make sure all the data is ready when the module is started and avoid lenghty
                        loading in case of big catalogs or slow network connection.

                            (see --relocate-profile command line option) this is the catalog that will be relocated.
                            There are two ways to define a catalog: one is providing an event file containing the ids
                            of existing origins; the second way consists in providing extended information

                            These options control the step 1 of real-time single event relocation. These options

                            line option).
                            The real-time relocation works in two steps: the first one is the location refinement,
                            in which scrtdd compute a preliminary relocation of the origin using only catalog
                            absolute travel times (dt.ct) and it is controlled by those options. A second step 
                            relocation is then performed, where scrtdd use both catalog absolute travel times (dt.ct)
                            and cross correlation differential travel times (dt.cc) for pairs of earthquakes, which
                            is controlled by step2options.
                            The multi-event (full catalog) relocation works in one step only, where the relocation
                            is performed with both catalog absolute travel times (dt.ct) and cross correlation
                            differential travel times (dt.cc),  both controlled by step2options.

                                    The dimension of the ellipsoid is based on the assumed error in the routine
                                    locations and the maximum interevent distance over which model errors can still
                                    be effectively minimized (see Waldhauser, 2001).
                                    The layers are twice as thick at the poles than they are at the equator to 
                                    accommodate the generally larger error in the depth of the routine location of
                                    a new event. Each layer is split up into its eight quadrants (or cells), and 
                                    the  neighboring events are selected from each of the 40 cells."
                                    SCRTDD selects neighbours for each ellipsoid/quadrant conbination in
                                    a round robin fashion until "maxNumNeigh" is reached. If there are no events
                                    in a specific ellipsoid/quadrant location it is simply skipped.
                                    Note: if numEllipsoids is 0 then the concentric ellipsoid algorithm will not
                                    be used and the events will be selected on nearest neighbor basis within a

                            The real-time relocation works in two steps: the first one is the location refinement,
                            in which scrtdd compute a preliminary relocation of the origin using only catalog
                            absolute travel times (dt.ct), and a second step relocation (controlled by these options),
                            where scrtdd  performs a more precise relocation using both catalog absolute 
                            travel times (dt.ct) and cross correlation differential travel times (dt.cc) for pairs 
                            of earthquakes.
                            The multi-event (full catalog) relocation works in one step only, where the relocation
                            is performed with both catalog absolute travel times (dt.ct) and cross correlation
                            differential travel times (dt.cc),  both controlled by step2options.

                                        The weighting scheme is based on pick class: weight = (1 / 2^class). The class is derived from pick time uncertainties:
                                        Class 0: 0-0.025 sec, class 1: 0.025-0.050 sec, class 2: 0.050-0.100 sec, class 3: 0.100-0.200 sec, class 4: 0.200-0.400 sec, class 5: over  0.400 sec.
                                        Picks without uncertainties have a fixed class of 1 if manual and class 4 if automatic.
