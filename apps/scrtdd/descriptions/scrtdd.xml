                        to release memory (e.g. catalog waveform data) after a period of inactivity at the cost of

                        points to a local disk source, in which case there is no advantace in
                        caching the waveforms).
                        It is safe to delete the cache folder, in which case the waveforms will be
                        loaded and saved again on disk the next time the profile is loaded (they will
                        be read again from the configured recordStream).
                        Please note that exists a command line options '--load-profile-wf' useful to
                        load all the catalog waveforms from the record stream and save them on disk.                         This is useful to make sure all the wavefrorms are on disk before when the
                        module is started and avoid lenghty loading the first time the module starts.

                            the messaging system.

                            as a whole (see --relocate-profile command line option).
                            There are two ways to define a catalog file: one is providing a single 
                            file containing the ids of existing origins; the second way consists in
                            providing 3 files event, phase and stations (in this format the origins
                            don't need to be present in the database).
                            The files must be in csv format with the first line containing the
                            column names. Each file requires a minimum set of columns, which can
                            appear in any order. Additional columns can be present and will not be

                            These options control the creation of double-difference observations
                            without cross-correlation and are used only in real-time single event
                            relocation but NOT in multi-event relocation (--relocate-profile 
                            command line option).
                            The real-time relocation works in two steps: the first one refines the
                            initial location creating double-difference observations from absolute
                            travel time differences and solving the system. The first step is
                            controlled by this option group.
                            A second step is then performed, starting from the refined location 
                            and solving again a double-difference system but this time using both
                            absolute travel times difference and cross correlation differential
                            travel times observations. The second step is controlled by 
                            'doubleDifferenceObservations' option group.

                                    From Waldhauser 2009: "to assure a spatially homogeneous subsampling, reference
                                    events are selected within each of five concentric, vertically elongated
                                    ellipsoidal layers of increasing thickness.
                                    The dimension of the ellipsoid is based on the assumed error in the routine
                                    locations and the maximum interevent distance over which model errors can still
                                    be effectively minimized (see Waldhauser, 2001).
                                    The layers are twice as thick at the poles than they are at the equator to 
                                    accommodate the generally larger error in the depth of the routine location of
                                    a new event. Each layer is split up into its eight quadrants (or cells), and 
                                    the  neighboring events are selected from each of the 40 cells."
                                    SCRTDD selects neighbours for each ellipsoid/quadrant conbination in
                                    a round robin fashion until "maxNumNeigh" is reached. If there are no events
                                    in a specific ellipsoid/quadrant location it is simply skipped.
                                    Note: if numEllipsoids is 0 then the concentric ellipsoid algorithm will not
                                    be used and the events will be selected on nearest neighbor basis within a
                                    search distance of maxEllipsoidSize. This is useful when performing multi-event
                                    relocation to build a background catalog where we seek a network of links between
                                    events so that there exists a chain of pairwise connected events from any one
                                    event to any other event, with the distance being as small as possible between
                                    connected events

                            These options control the creation of double-difference observations
                            with cross-correlation and are used both in real-time single event
                            relocation and in multi-event relocation (--relocate-profile 
                            command line option).
                            The real-time relocation works in two steps: the first one refines the
                            initial location creating double-difference observations from absolute
                            travel time differences and solving the system. The first step is
                            controlled by 'doubleDifferenceObservationsNoXcorr' option group.
                            A second step is then performed, starting from the refined location 
                            and solving again a double-difference system but this time using both
                            absolute travel times difference and cross correlation differential
                            travel times observations. The second step is controlled by this
                            option group.
                            The multi-event relocation works in one step only and it uses this 
                            option group.

                                Wihtin an event pair, an observation is created for every station

                                To build the event pairs a clustering algorithm is performed, joining
                                together events within a given distance and fulfilling specific
                                requirements which are confiurable in here

                                weight 1.0 (unless a priori weights options is used). In subsequent 
                                iterations each observation is downweighted accordingly to its 
                                residuals, which allows to eventualy get rid of bad observations

                                different than 0 enables the solver to use a damped least squares system instead

                                experiment with the two options independently (disable one of the 
                                two) before mixing them together.
                                The units used in the double-difference sytem are km and seconds,
                                so a dampingFactor value of 1 weighs as much as 1 km on changes
                                to lat/lon/depth and 1 second to changes in origin time

                                Constrain the mean shift of all earthquakes during relocation to zero.
                                This is useful to avoid the shifting of the full cluster as the
                                result of the relocation. However a small shift of the cluster
                                centroid can be allowed to correct for possible errors in the
                                initial absolute locations.
                                4 weight values are required: longitude, latitude, depth and time
                                constraint weights. A weight of zero means no constraint.

                                Those options allow the double-difference equations to have different
                                starting weights. By default they are equally weighted and the
                                residual itselfs drive the re-weighting (see downWeightingByResidual
                                option). So these settings shouldn't be strictly necessary but
                                it could be interesting to experiment with them
