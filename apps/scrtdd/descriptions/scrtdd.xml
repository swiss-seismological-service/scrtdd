                        the next time the profile is loaded (they will be read again from the configured
                        recordStream).

                            (see --relocate-profile command line option) this is the catalog that will be relocated.
                            There are two ways to define a catalog: one is providing an event file containing the ids
                            of existing events or origins; the second way consists in providing extended information 
                            (useful when the events are not in the database) and three files are required event, phase

                            The files must be in csv format with the first line containing the column names. Each file
                            requires a minimum set of columns, which can appear in any order. Additional

                            for pairs of events (dt.ct file in HypoDD terminology), which are used in step 1 of

                            relocation (--relocate-profile  command line option).
                            The real-time relocation works in two steps: location refinement, the first step in
                            which hypoDD compute a preliminary relocation of the origin using only catalog
                            absolute travel times (dt.ct), which is controlled by those options, and a second step 
                            relocation, where scrtdd  performs a more precise relocation using both catalog absolute 
                            travel times (dt.ct) and cross correlation differential travel times (dt.cc) for pairs

                            The multi-event (full catalog) relocation works in one step only, where the relocation

                                    The dimension of the ellipsoid is based on the assumed error in the routine
                                    locations and the maximum interevent distance over which model errors can still
                                    be effectively minimized (see Waldhauser, 2001).
                                    The layers are twice as thick at the poles than they are at the equator to 
                                    accommodate the generally larger error in the depth of the routine location of
                                    a new event. Each layer is split up into its eight quadrants (or cells), and 
                                    the  neighboring events are selected from each of the 40 cells.
                                    Note: if numEllipsoids is 0 then the concentric ellipsoid algorithm will not
                                    be used and the events will be selected on nearest neighbor basis within a
                                    search distance of maxEllipsoidSize. This is useful when performing multi-event
                                    relocation to build a background catalog where we seek a network of links between
                                    events so that there exists a chain of pairwise connected events from any one
