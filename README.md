# Description

rtDD is a [SeisComP](<https://github.com/SeisComP>) extension module that implements Double-Difference event relocation both in Real-Time, one event at the time, and classic offline mode, where an earthquake catalog is relocated as a whole.

The actual methods are based on the paper "Near-Real-Time Double-Difference Event Location Using Long-Term Seismic Archives, with Application to Northern California" by Felix Waldhauser and "A Double-Difference Earthquake Location Algorithm: Method and Application to the Northern Hayward Fault, California" by Waldhauser & Ellsworth.

The double-difference equation system solver uses [LSQR by Chris Paige, Michael Saunders](<https://web.stanford.edu/group/SOL/software/lsqr/>) and [LSMR by David Fong, Michael Saunders](<https://web.stanford.edu/group/SOL/software/lsmr/>) algorithms from [this](<https://github.com/tvercaut/LSQR-cpp/>) Apache Licensed beautiful implementation by Tom Vercautereen.

rtDD also supports [NonLinLoc by Anthony Lomax](<http://alomax.free.fr/nlloc/>) grid file format alongside the travel time formats natively supported by SeisComP (LOCSAT and libtau). A feature that enables 3D velocity models within the tool.

rtDD acknowledges support from [Geothermica](http://www.geothermica.eu/)

## Documentation

You can find the online documentation at https://docs.gempa.de/scrtdd/current/

## Installation from binaries

You can find compiled version of this module at https://data.gempa.de/packages/Public/. The installation file is a compressed tar archive containing the binary distribution of this module, which can be extracted in your SeisComP installation folder.

## Installation from source code

In order to use this module the sources have to be merged into the *SeisComP* sources, then *SeisComP* can be compiled and installed as usual. Follow the up-to-date procedure at https://github.com/SeisComP/seiscomp

<pre>
#
# get SeisComP (follow official documentation)
#
git clone https://github.com/SeisComP/seiscomp.git seiscomp
cd seiscomp/src/base
git clone https://github.com/SeisComP/common.git
git clone https://github.com/SeisComP/main.git
[...etc...]

#
# Add rtdd into SeisComP
#
cd seiscomp/src/extras
git clone https://github.com/swiss-seismological-service/scrtdd.git
cd scrtdd

#
# Compile code as per SeisComP official documentation
#
...
</pre>
