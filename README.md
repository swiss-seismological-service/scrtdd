# Description

rtDD is a [SeisComP](<https://github.com/SeisComP>) extension module that implements Double-Difference event relocation both in Real-Time, one event at the time, and classic offline mode, where an earthquake catalog is relocated as a whole.

The actual methods are based on the paper "Near-Real-Time Double-Difference Event Location Using Long-Term Seismic Archives, with Application to Northern California" by Felix Waldhauser and "A Double-Difference Earthquake Location Algorithm: Method and Application to the Northern Hayward Fault, California" by Waldhauser & Ellsworth.

The double-difference equation system solver uses [LSQR by Chris Paige, Michael Saunders](<https://web.stanford.edu/group/SOL/software/lsqr/>) and [LSMR by David Fong, Michael Saunders](<https://web.stanford.edu/group/SOL/software/lsmr/>) algorithms from [this](<https://github.com/tvercaut/LSQR-cpp/>) Apache Licensed beautiful implementation by Tom Vercautereen.

rtDD also supports [NonLinLoc by Anthony Lomax](<http://alomax.free.fr/nlloc/>) grid file format alongside the travel time formats natively supported by SeisComP (LOCSAT and libtau). A feature that enables 3D velocity models within the tool.

## Compile

In order to use this module the sources have to be compiled to an executable. Merge the scrtdd code into the *SeisComP* sources and compile *SeisComP* as usual.

## 1. Multi-event relocation

Long story short:

* Use `sclistorg` command to select an event catalog from a SeisComP database.

* Create a `scrtdd` profile (e.g. use `scconfig` GUI) which defines the settings for the relocation. The default values provided by `scrtdd` are meant to be a good starting choice, so there is no need to tweak every parameter. However, it is a good choice to configure a custom velocity model.

* Use `scrtdd --reloc-catalog` option to relocate the events.

* Use the relocation output (`reloc-event.csv`, `reloc-phase.csv` and `reloc-stations.csv` or the SCML file `relocated.xml`) as you please

As an example you may want to have a look at `multi-event.sh` script in [this folder](/data/scripts/).

To relocate events not stored in a SeisComP database, refer to [this paragraph](#134-relocating-external-data).

### The long story

The multi-event relocation consists of two steps: selecting the candidate origins and using `scrtdd` to relocate those. For the former task an utility `sclistorg` might come in handy. For the latter we need to configure a `scrtdd` profile where the relocation options are stored and then run the command line option `--reloc-catalog`. That's it.

The output will be another catalog containing the relocated origins. The configuration is an easy task since the default options should already provide sensible solutions. The input origins might come from different sources: a SeisComP database (local or remote), a xml file, or a `scrtdd` specific format (station.csv,event.csv,phase.csv triplet, explained later).

In multi-event mode there is no interaction neither with the running SeisComP modules. It is a safe operation and allow for easy experimenting. The relocated events will be stored in plain text files, so that they can be analysed  externally to SeisComP, but they can also be stored back into the database. That is optional.

`scrtdd` supports also the standard options (`--inventory-db inventory.xml --config-db config.xml`) that allows to read the station inventory from plain files, making the database fully optional when the event catalog is provided as plain files.


### 1.1 How to get the origin ids?

There is a tool that is installed alongside `scrtdd`, called `sclistorg`, that is useful for listing origin ids satisfying certain criteria, such as time period, geographic area, author, agency and so on. E.g.

```sh
# list the preferred origin ids for all events between 2018-11-27 and 2018-12-14
sclistorg --begin "2018-11-27 00:00:00" --end "2018-12-14 00:00:00" --org-type preferred [db options]

# select also the event type and the accepted agencies
sclistorg --begin "2018-11-27 00:00:00" --end "2018-12-14 00:00:00" --org-type preferred \
          --ev-type "earthquake,quarry blast" --inc-agency Agency1,Agency2 [db options]

# select an area of interest, a rectangle minLat,minLon,maxLat,maxLon
sclistorg --begin "2018-11-27 00:00:00" --end "2018-12-14 00:00:00" --org-type preferred \
          --area 46.0,8.5,46.5,8.7 [db options]

```
See `sclistorg --help` for a full list of options.

```
Events:
  --begin arg                   specify the lower bound of the time interval
  --end arg                     specify the upper bound of the time interval
  --modified-after arg          select events modified after the specified time
  --ev-type arg                 include only events whose type is one of the
                                values provided (comma separated list)
  --simple                      Print only origin ids

Origins:
  --org-type arg                preferred, last or first (default is preferred)
  --manual-only                 Include only manual origins
  --auto-only                   Inlude only automatic origins
  --inc-author arg              include only origins whose author is one of the
                                values provided (comma separated list)
  --excl-author arg             exclude origins whose author is one of the
                                values provided (comma separated list)
  --inc-method arg              include only origins whose methodID is one of
                                the values provided (comma separated list)
  --excl-method arg             exclue origins whose methodID is one of the
                                values provided (comma separated list)
  --inc-agency arg              include only origins whose agencyID is one of
                                the values provided (comma separated list)
  --excl-agency arg             exclude origins whose agencyID is one of the
                                values provided (comma separated list)
  --area arg                    Include only origins in the rectangular area
                                provided: MinLat,MinLon,MaxLat,MaxLon
```

### 1.2 Preparing the candidate events

The origin ids of the events to be relocated must be stored in a format that `scrtdd` understands.

One of the compatible formats is a text file containing the origin IDs (`sclistorg` output is compatible with that). `scrtdd` will use the origin IDs in the file to fetch all necessary information from the SeisComP database.

E.g. *file myCatalog.csv* (a mandatory column named `seiscompId` is required, but other column might be present too).

```
seiscompId
Origin/20181214107387.056851.253104
Origin/20180053105627.031726.697885
Origin/20190121103332.075405.6234534
Origin/20190223103327.031726.346363
[...]
```

There is another format we can use to store a catalog. This format contains the full origins information, not only the origin ids. So, once the files are generated, there is no need to access the database anymore; so this format is quite fast to load. We can instruct `scrtdd` to generate such a format with the following command:

```
scrtdd --dump-catalog myCatalog.csv --verbosity=3 --console=1 [db options]
```

The above command will generate three files (*event.csv*, *phase.csv* and *stations.csv*) which contain all the information needed by `scrtdd`. 

E.g. *file event.csv* (`magnitude` and `rms` columns are currently not used and their value is not relevant)

```
id,isotime,latitude,longitude,depth,magnitude,rms
1,2019-11-05T00:54:21.256705Z,46.318264,7.365509,4.7881,3.32,0.174

3,2019-11-05T01:06:27.140654Z,46.325626,7.356148,3.9756,0.84,0.083
4,2019-11-05T01:12:25.753816Z,46.325012,7.353627,3.7090,0.39,0.144
```

E.g. *file station.csv*

```
id,latitude,longitude,elevation,networkCode,stationCode,locationCode
4D.MH36.A,45.980278,7.670195,3463.0,4D,MH36,A
4D.MH48.A,45.978720,7.663000,4003.0,4D,MH48,A
4D.RA43.,46.585719,8.383171,2320.4,4D,RA43,
8D.AMIDI.00,45.903349,6.885881,2250.0,8D,AMIDI,00
8D.NVL3.,46.371345,6.873937,379.0,8D,NVL3,
```

E.g. *file phase.csv* (`lowerUncertainty` and `upperUncertainty` are used only when `profile.myProfile.solver.aPrioriWeights.usePickUncertainties` is set to `true`)

```
eventId,stationId,isotime,lowerUncertainty,upperUncertainty,type,networkCode,stationCode,locationCode,channelCode,evalMode

```
With this format it is possible to relocate events that are not stored in any SeisComP database, since all the origins information are contained in those files.

Finally, the events to be relocated can also be stored in SeisComP XML format. Please refer to the official SeisComP  documentation of `scxmldump`, a very convenient tool for dumping events to XML file.


### 1.3 Relocating the candidate events

Before performing the relocation we need to create a new profile in the `scrtdd` configuration where it is possible to select the values for the relocation steps: double-difference system creation, cross-correlation and solver.

![Profile options](/data/img/configOverview.png?raw=true "Profile options")

The default values provided by `scrtdd` are meant to be a good starting choice, so there is no need to tweak every parameter. However, it is a good choice to configure a custom velocity model (`solver.travelTimeTable`). The cross-correlation parameters are described in a dedicated paragraph. Finally, when the configuration is ready, we can relocate the catalog with the following commands...

#### 1.3.1 Relocating a file containing a list of origin ids

```
scrtdd --reloc-catalog myCatalog.csv --profile myProfile \
       --verbosity=3 --console=1 [db options] 
```

E.g. *file myCatalog.csv*

```
seiscompId
Origin/20181214107387.056851.253104
Origin/20180053105627.031726.697885
[...]
```
 
#### 1.3.2 Relocating the station.csv,event.csv,phase.csv triplet

```
# station.csv,event.csv,phase.csv are generated with `scrtdd --dump-catalog`
scrtdd --reloc-catalog station.csv,event.csv,phase.csv --profile myProfile \
       --verbosity=3 --console=1 [db options] 
```

#### 1.3.3 Relocating an XML/SCML file

Events are stored in a XML file in [SCML format](https://www.seiscomp.de/doc/base/glossary.html#term-SCML). It is possible to convert between different formats with [sccnv command](https://www.seiscomp.de/doc/apps/sccnv.html).

```
# events.xml contais the events data (scxmldump command)
# myCatalog.csv contains the origin ids inside events.xml we want relocate
scrtdd --reloc-catalog myCatalog.csv --ep events.xml --profile myProfile \
       --verbosity=3 --console=1 [db options] 
```

#### 1.3.4 Relocating external data

To relocate external (non SeisComP) data three pieces of information need to be provided: events data, waveform data and inventory information:

* events data has to be provided in [SCML format](https://www.seiscomp.de/doc/base/glossary.html#term-SCML). It is possible to convert between different formats with [sccnv command](https://www.seiscomp.de/doc/apps/sccnv.html). Events data can be passed to `scrtdd` via `--ep events.xml` option together with `--reloc-catalog` option
* alternatively the events data can be converted to a station.csv,event.csv,phase.csv file triplet, explained in the previous paragraphs and passed to `scrtdd` via `--reloc-catalog station.csv,event.csv,phase.csv` option
* Waveform data can to be provided via `-I RecordStream` command line option and the RecordStream can be any of the [SeisComP supported ones](https://www.seiscomp.de/doc/apps/global_recordstream.html#global-recordstream)
* [Inventory information](https://www.seiscomp.de/doc/base/concepts/inventory.html) has be converted from an external format into SeisComP own station meta-data XML format called inventory ML. This can be passed to `scrtdd` via `--inventory-db inventory.xml` (or stored in the SeisComP database)


Examples:

```
scrtdd --reloc-catalog station.csv,event.csv,phase.csv --profile myProfile \
       -I sdsarchive:///home/sysop/seiscomp/var/lib/archive \
       --inventory-db inventory.xml \
       --verbosity=3 --console=1
```

```
# myCatalog.csv contains the origin ids inside events.xml we want relocate
scrtdd --reloc-catalog myCatalog.csv --ep events.xml --profile myProfile \
       -I fdsnws://service.iris.edu:80/fdsnws/dataselect/1/query  \
       --inventory-db inventory.xml \
       --verbosity=3 --console=1
```

### 1.4 Review of results

Independently on how the input events are provided, `scrtdd` will output a set of files *reloc-event.csv*, *reloc-phase.csv* and *reloc-stations.csv*, these contain the relocated catalog.

At this point we should check the relocated events which contains several statistics and the logs to see whether the results make sense and are satisfactory. Usually we want to keep tuning the `scrtdd` settings and relocate the catalog multiple times until we are sure we reached the best relocations. Having a good background catalog is the base for good real-time relocations.

**Notes**:
Be aware that the first time you try to relocate a catalog it can be very slow because the waveforms have to be downloaded from the configured recordStream and saved to disk for the next runs, which will be much faster. 

To enable `scrtdd` in real-time the output files reloc-event.csv reloc-phase.csv and reloc-stations.csv are required as they will become the background catalog for the real-time/single-event relocation.

![Catalog selection option](/data/img/catalog-selection3.png?raw=true "Catalog selection from raw file format")


### 1.5 Useful options

In addition to the options we have already seen, there are also some other useful ones.

`--xmlout` option can be used in combination with `--reloc-catalog` to generate a XML output, which is useful to later insert the relocated catalog in a SeisComP database (e.g. scdb command).

E.g.
```
scrtdd --reloc-catalog myCatalog.csv --profile myProfile \
       --verbosity=3 --console=1 [db options]
       --xmlout > relocated-catalog.xml
```

`--merge-catalogs` and `--merge-catalogs-keepid` are useful to merge several catalogs into a single one. 

```
scrtdd --merge-catalogs station1.csv,event1.csv,phase1.csv,station2.csv,event2.csv,phase2.csv
```

Here is a list of all the options we have seen so far:

```
scrtdd --help

Mode:

  --reloc-catalog arg                   Relocate the catalog passed as argument
                                        in multi-event mode. The input can be a
                                        single file (containing seiscomp origin
                                        ids) or a file triplet
                                        (station.csv,event.csv,phase.csv). For
                                        events stored in a XML files add the
                                        --ep option. Use in combination with
                                        --profile

  --ep arg                              Event parameters XML file for offline
                                        processing of contained origins
                                        (implies --test option). Each contained
                                        origin will be processed in
                                        signle-event mode unless
                                        --reloc-catalog is provided, which
                                        enable multi-event mode.

ModeOptions:

  --profile arg                         To be used in combination with other 
                                        options: select the profile 
                                        configuration to use

  --xmlout                              Enable XML output when combined with 
                                        --reloc-catalog or --oring-id options

Catalog:

  --dump-catalog arg                    Dump the seiscomp event/origin id file 
                                        passed as argument into a catalog file 
                                        triplet (station.csv,event.csv,phase.cs
                                        v).

  --merge-catalogs arg                  Merge in a single catalog all the 
                                        catalog file triplets 
                                        (station1.csv,event1.csv,phase1.csv,sta

#### Examples

Here are a few catalogs before and after `scrtdd` relocation:

The unit testing folder contains the code to generate some tests with synthetic data:

### 1.6 A continuously updated multi-event relocated catalog

Thanks to the integration in SeisComP it is quite easy to use `scrtdd` to periodically generate a double-difference catalog of a region, so that recent events are continuously included in the double-difference inversion. This is not only useful for having up-to-date snapshots of high quality earthquakes locations for a region, but it is crucial for real-time double-difference inversion, where new origins are relocated against a reference (background) catalog: the more updated the background catalog is, the better the results. This is especially important when monitoring regions where the historical seismicity unknown. For this purpose it might come in handy the `generate-background-catalog.sh` script in [this folder](/data/scripts/), that can be easily adapted to the specific use case and it is useful to periodically generate a multi-event relocated catalog, which can be also displayed in an interactive map, given a web server is available.

![Relocation example picture](/data/img/multiEventRelocationContinuousExample.png?raw=true "Continuously updated relocation example") 

## 2. Real-time single-event relocation

Long story short:

* Use the multi-event relocation feature to prepare a background catalog

* Create a `scrtdd` profile or use the same profile used for generating the background catalog, then set the profile background catalog and add the profile to the list of active real-time profiles (`activeProfiles` parameter). The default profile parameter values are meant to be a good starting choice, so there is no need to tweak them heavily. However, it is a good choice to configure a custom velocity model (`solver.travelTimeTable`)

* Make sure to read "Avoiding Relocation Loops" paragraph to avoid a potential issue

* Enable and start `scrtdd` (`seiscomp enable scrtdd`, `seiscomp start scrtdd`)

### The long story

To enable the real-time processing a profile should be created and enabled by including it in `scrtdd.activeProfiles` option.
 
In real-time processing `scrtdd` relocates new origins, one a time as they occur, against a background catalog of high quality events. Those high quality events can be generated via multi-event relocation, which has already been covered in the previous sections.

Real time relocation uses the same configuration we have seen in full catalog relocation, but real time relocation is done in two steps:

**Step 1**: location refinement. In this step `scrtdd` performs a preliminary relocation of the origin where the differential travel times in the double-difference system are derived from the pick times.

**Step 2**: the refined location computed in the previous step is used as starting location to perform a more precise relocation using cross-correlation to refine the differential travel times. If step1 fails, step2 is attempted anyway.

If step2 completes successfully the relocated origin is sent to the messaging system. 

### 2.1. Configuring a background catalog

The easiest choice is to use as background catalog the relocated multi-event results; the triplet *reloc-event.csv*, *phase.csv*, *station.csv*:

![Catalog selection option](/data/img/catalog-selection3.png?raw=true "Catalog selection from raw file format")

However, if the catalog is generated in XML format, it can be imported in the SeisComP database. In this case the background catalog can be a file containing just the origin ids. 

![Catalog selection option](/data/img/catalog-selection1.png?raw=true "Catalog selection from event/origin ids")

While it is neat to have the background catalog in the SeisComP database, this approach has few limitations. First it may take a lot of time for `scrtdd` to load a big catalog from the database comparing to loading it from files. Also, since the background catalog should be periodically updated, old events are continuously updated with new origins, which can lead to a not optimal database performance-wise.

Once the background catalog is configured `scrtdd` can be enabled and started as any other SeisComP module.  New origins will be relocated as soon as they arrive in the messaging system.

### 2.2 Testing

You might consider testing the configuration relocating some existing events to make sure the parameters are suitable for your use case. To test the real time relocation there are two command line options which relocate existing origins:

```
scrtdd --help

Mode:

  -O [ --origin-id ] arg                Relocate  the origin (or multiple 
                                        comma-separated origins) in 
                                        signle-event mode and send a message. 
                                        Each origin will be processed 
                                        accordingly to the matching profile 
                                        region unless the --profile option  is 
                                        used.
  --ep arg                              Event parameters XML file for offline 
                                        processing of contained origins 
                                        (implies --test option). Each contained
                                        origin will be processed in 
                                        signle-event mode unless 
                                        --reloc-catalog is provided, which 
                                        enable multi-event mode.

ModeOptions:

   --profile arg                        To be used in combination with other 
                                        options: select the profile 
                                        configuration to use

  --test                                Test mode, no messages are sent when 
                                        relocating a single event

  --xmlout                              Enable XML output when combined with 
                                        --reloc-catalog or --oring-id options

```

#### 2.2.1 Relocate origin ID and send the relocation to the messaging system for further processing

If we want to process an origin we can run the following command and then check on `scolv` the relocated origin (the messaging system must be active). This is mostly useful when we want to relocate an origin on a running system and keep the relocation:

```
scrtdd --origin-id someOriginId \
       --verbosity=3 --console=1 [db options] 
```

#### 2.2.2 Relocate origin ID but do not send the relocation (debug)

As above but add `--test` and the origin will not be sent to the messaging system. Useful for troubleshooting when the `scrtdd.saveProcessingFiles` option is enabled to verify the relocation files in `scrtdd.workingDirectory`.

```
scrtdd --origin-id someOriginId --test \
       --verbosity=3 --console=1 [db options]
``` 

#### 2.2.3 Relocate origin ID and store the result to XML file

Adding the `--xmlout` option allows to save the origin as a XML file. We can finally open the ile with `scolv` for inspection:

```
scrtdd --origin-id someOriginId --xmlout \
       --verbosity=3 --console=1 [db options] \
  >  relocated-origin.xml
```

#### 2.2.4 Relocate XML file and store the result to XML file

Similarly to other SeisComP commands the `--ep` option can be used for full offline processing. All origins contained in the input XML file are relocated.

```
scrtdd --ep origin.xml --verbosity=3 --console=1 [db options] \
  > relocated-origin.xml
```

### 2.3 Phase update

`scrtdd` uses cross-correlation to detect phases at stations with no associated picks in order to fix the pick time and uncertainty of automatic picks. Those features are especially useful in real-time to increase the quality and number of double-difference observations when automatic origins have only few picks/phases.

For automatic picks, the pick time is updated according to the average lag detected by all the good (above configured threshold) cross-correlation results. Since the real-time events are cross-correlated against catalog events, which have good manual picks, the updated pick time is expected to improve. The pick uncertainty is derived from the uncertainties of catalog-events. If no cross-correlation coefficients above the configured threshold are found, the pick is kept untouched.

For stations with no associated phases, `scrtdd` computes theoretical picks. Those are then cross-correlated against the catalog event ones. Every theoretical pick that has at least one good cross-correlation result is added to the relocated origin, with pick time and uncertainties derived from catalog phases (similarly to what is done for automatic picks). Those *good* theoretical picks are thus used in the double-difference system inversion. Theoretical picks that have no good cross-correlation results are simply discarded.

Picks that have been updated or created by `scrtdd` are identifiable by a `x` suffix (Px, Sx).

Manual picks are never modified.

### 2.4 Avoiding Relocation Loops

`scrtdd` listens and sends messages to the LOCATION group. In a default installation where the only locator is `scautoloc` that's not an issue: `scautoloc` will send an origin to LOCATION and `scrtdd` will receive it and send an updated origin to LOCATION.  However, when there are multiple (re)locators (e.g. scanloc, screloc) that listen to LOCATION and send their own updated origin to LOCATION too, then an infinite loop happens! In this case a new messaging group needs to be created, e.g. RELOCATION, so that the origins flow from LOCATION to RELOCATION without going back.

 E.g. of a properly configured system:

```
                      LISTEN                       SEND 
              (MessagingSubscription)      (PrimaryMessagingGroup)
scautoloc             ...                        LOCATION
scanloc       LOCATION, ...                      LOCATION
screloc       LOCATION, ...                     RELOCATION
scrtdd        LOCATION, ...                     RELOCATION
scevent       LOCATION,RELOCATION, ...             ...
scamp         LOCATION,RELOCATION, ...             ...
scmag         LOCATION,RELOCATION, ...             ...
```

### Examples

![Synthetic Data Relocation example picture](/data/img/singleEventRelocationSyntDataExample.png?raw=true "Synthetic Data Relocation example")

## 3. Cross-correlation

Good cross-correlation results are needed to achieve high quality double-difference observations, which in turn results in high resolution relocations. The purpose of the cross-correlation is to find the exact time difference between two picks of an event pair at a common station. The cross-correlation is automatically performed by `scrtdd` before the double-difference inversion.

The default values of the cross-correlation parameters are meant to be a good starting point, however it might be useful to optimize them in certain scenarios.

![Relocation options](/data/img/xcorr.png?raw=true "Relocation options")

### 3.1 Eval-xcorr command

The `--eval-xcorr` command can be used to evaluate the cross-correlation parameter. 

`--eval-xcorr` allows to see:
* `#pha`: how many phases have been cross-correlated
* `pha good CC`: how many of those were successful (correlation coefficient above the configured threshold)
* `coeff`: the average correlation coefficient
* `goodCC/ph`: the average number of good matches per phase (each event phase appears in multiple double-difference observations, so multiple event pais, hence multiple cross-correlations)
* `time-diff`: the average pick time difference detected by the cross-correlation
* `+/-`: whenever sensible, it is also indicated the Mean Absolute Deviation of the value

It is especially interesting to compare the results before/after the catalog has been relocated. The new statistics should show better performance for events close to each other and gradually worsen with increasing inter-event distance. That is an indirect measure of the quality of the relocation as explained in Waldhauser & Ellsworth's paper.

```
scrtdd --eval-xcorr station.csv,event.csv,phase.csv --profile myProfile --verbosity=2 --console=1
```

Example output:

```

### 3.2 Cross-correlation parameters optimization

The `--eval-xcorr` option should be used to properly configure the cross-correlation parameters. The optimization process involves running `--eval-xcorr` with different configuration and analyzes the results. The goal is to have as many matches as possible (increase `GoodCC`) avoiding bad/false matches (very high values of `time-diff` are probably an indication of false matches): this is a trade-off.

The configuration parameters that are relevant for this analysis are:
* Cross-correlation coefficient threshold for P and S
* Cross-correlation window length for P and S
* Cross-correlation maximum lag/delay for P and S
* Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) configuration
* Waveform filter (and resampling)
* Clustering: number of neighbours

The SNR is particularly important to reject bad picks that lead to bad cross-correlations. The SNR signal/noise windows should be chosen so that they satisfies ALL the following 5 conditions:

* pick time too early (we want low SNR)
* pick time too late (we want low SNR)
* pick time perfect  (we want high SNR)
* pick time is early but acceptable (we want high SNR)
* pick time is late but acceptable (we want high SNR)

There are also few more parameters that are less relevant, but that might become important when relocating automatic origins (the automatic location might be very far from the final solution):
* Cross-correlation maximum station distance
* Cross-correlation maximum inter-event distance
* Clustering: maximum inter-event distance
* Clustering: station to inter-event distance ratio  

### 3.3 Logs

Some cross-correlation statistics are printed in both multi-event and single-event mode. Those can be seen in the log file or in the console output if `--console=1 --verbosity=3`) is used.

```
[info] Cross-correlation statistics: performed 40361, waveforms with Signal to Noise ratio too low 2435, waveforms not available 98
[info] Total xcorr 40361 (P 59%, S 41%) success 28% (11499/40361). Successful P 22% (5300/23844). Successful S 38% (6199/16517)
[info] xcorr on actual picks 24784/40361 (P 60%, S 40%) success 37% (9186/24784). Successful P 31% (4629/14761). Successful S 45% (4557/10023)
[info] xcorr on theoretical picks 15577/40361 (P 58%, S 42%) success 15% (2313/15577). Successful P 7% (671/9083). Successful S 25% (1642/6494)
```

The statistics are broken down in actual picks and theoretical picks. This is because `scrtdd` computes theoretical picks that are cross-correlated together with detected picks. This is useful to increase the number of double-difference observations. See the [Phase update](#24-phase-update) paragraph for further details. 

### 3.4 Waveforms inspection

A more in-depth source of information for waveform filtering and SNR options comes from this option:


```
scrtdd --help
  --debug-wf                            Enable saving of processed waveforms 
                                        into the profile working directory for 
                                        inspection.
```

Simply adding `--debug-wf` to the command line will make `scrtdd` dump to disk miniseed files for inspection (e.g. `scrttv` waveformfile.mseed). Just make sure to delete the folder before using this option to make sure to not look at previous relocation output. This option can be added to any `scrtdd` commands (e.g. `--relocate-profile`, `--ev`, `--origin-id` ) but it is mostly useful when relocating a single event mode because in multi-event mode there will be way too many waveforms to be able to check them all manually, although we can still do some random check to get an overall feeling of the filtering and SNR.

The generated waveforms will be stored in `workingDirectory/profileName/wfdebug/` (e.g. `~/seiscomp3/var/lib/rtdd/myProfile/wfdebug/`) after filtering and resampling, that is the same waveforms used for the cross-correlation. The file names follow the patterns:

* *evNumber.NET.STATION.phaseTime.manual.mseed*       (e.g. ev56.CH.SAYF2.S.manual.mseed)       - event 56 manual S phase on CH.SAYF2 station
* *evNumber.NET.STATION.phaseTime.automatic.mseed*    (e.g  ev4.CH.SAYF2.P.automatic.mseed)     - event 4 automatic P phase on CH.SAYF2 station
* *evNumber.NET.STATION.phaseTime.theoretical.mseed*  (e.g. ev267.CH.SFRU.Pt.theoretical.mseed) - event 267 theoretical P phase on CH.SFRU station
* *evNumber.NET.STATION.phaseTime.snr-rejected.mseed* (e.g. ev9.XY.VET02.S.snr-rejected.mseed)  - event 9 S phase not used in cross-correlation due to the configured signal to noise ratio threshold

Also, `scrtdd` logs tell us the details of the cross-correlation, so that we can see what waveform was cross-correlated with which others and then inspect the corresponding waveform miniseed files e.g.:

For comparison we can always find the raw waveforms (not processed) fetched from the configured recordStream and used as a cache in `workingDirectory/profileName/wfcache/` (e.g. `~/seiscomp3/var/lib/rtdd/myProfile/wfcache/`):
* `NET.ST.LOC.CH.startime-endtime.mseed`


## 4. Waveform data and recordStream configuration

SeisComP applications access waveform data through the RecordStream interface (see [official SeisComP documentation](https://www.seiscomp.de/doc/base/concepts/recordstream.html) for more details) and it is usually configured in *global.cfg* or passed via command line with `-I URI`. The RecordStream parameters define the service(s) through which SeisComP can access real-time and historical waveforms data (seedlink, fdsn, sds archive, [etc](https://www.seiscomp.de/doc/apps/global_recordstream.html)). A hypothetical RecordStream configuration might look like this:

```
recordstream = combined://slink/localhost:18000;sdsarchive//path/to/miniseed
```

This configuration is a combination of seedlink and sds archive, which allows `scrtdd` to retrieve catalog waveforms via sds and real-time event data via seedlink.

Please note that depending on the responsiveness of the seedlink server the real-time relocations may incur in delays. A couple of configuration options allow to control those delays: *timeout* and *retries*. The example below forces a timeout of 5 seconds (default is 5 minutes) and to not reconnect. In case of a timeout, `scrtdd` will proceed with the available data, without further delays:

```
recordstream = combined://slink/localhost:18000?timeout=5&retries=0;sdsarchive//path/to/miniseed
```


### 4.1 Waveforms data caching

Unless the recordStream points to a local disk storage, downloading waveforms might require a lot of time. For this reason `scrtdd` stores the waveforms to disk (called waveform cache) after downloading them. This applies only to the catalog event waveforms, which are used over and over again. That's not true for the real-time events, whose waveforms are used just once and never cached. The cache folder is `workingDirectory/profileName/wfcache/`.

However, for certain situations (e.g. debugging) it might be useful to cache all the waveforms, even the ones that are normally not cached. For those special cases the option --cache-wf-all can be used (stored in `workingDirectory/profileName/tmpcache/` which can be deleted afterwards).


### 4.2 Catalog waveforms preloading

When `scrtdd` starts for the first time it loads all the catalog waveforms and stores them to disk. However, if the option `performance.profileTimeAlive` is greater than 0, the catalog waveforms will be loaded only when needed (lazy loading) and not at start time. We can also force `scrtdd` to pre-download all waveforms using the following option:

```
scrtdd --load-profile-wf --profile myprofile
```

```
scrtdd --help
  --load-profile-wf                     Load catalog waveforms from the 
                                        configured recordstream and save them 
                                        into the profile working directory. Use
                                        in combination with --profile

  --profile arg                         To be used in combination with other 
                                        options: select the profile 
                                        configuration to use

```

## 5. Database connection

When SeisComP modules need to access the database for reading or writing data (events, picks, magnitudes, etc.) they use the connection string configured in either `global.cfg` (which is inherited by every module) or in `scmaster.cfg`, in which case is scmaster module that passes the database connection string to every module when they connect to the messaging system (usually at module startup).

However, when running `scrtdd` from the command line, it doesn't connect to the messaging system and if the database connection is specified via `scmaster.cfg`, the information never reaches `scrtdd`. In this case the database connection must be passed as a command line option:

```
scrtdd [some options] -d  mysql://user:password@host/seiscompDbName
```

or in case of a Postgresql database:

```
scrtdd [some options] --plugins dbpostgresql -d postgresql://user:password@host/seiscompDbName
```

It is worth noting that this feature allows `scrtdd` to connect to remote seiscomp databases too and relocate events stored in other machines without interfering with the real-time processing happening there.
 

## 6. Troubleshooting

Log files are located in ~/.seiscomp/log/scrtdd.log. Alternatively, when running `scrtdd` from the command line, the following options can be used to see the logs on the console:

```
scrtdd [some options] --verbosity=3 --console=1
```

Verbosity 3 should be preferred to level 4, since the debug level 4 makes the logs hard to read due to the huge amount of information.

Also, enabling the `scrtdd.saveProcessingFiles` option makes `scrtdd` generates multiple information files inside `scrtdd.workingDirectory`. Those files can be useful for careful inspections of the relocations.

### 6.1 Single-event

```

### 6.3 Relocation statistics

`scrtdd` adds two comments to each relocated origin: `scrtddSourceOrigin` and `scrtddRelocationReport`. They can be both visualized in `scolv` (see official SeisComP documentation on how to do so), or they can be seen on the logs.

`scrtddSourceOrigin` contains the id of the origin that triggered the relocation. `scrtddRelocationReport` contains a summary of the relocation process. E.g.

```
Origin changes: location=0.23[km] depth=1.40[km] time=-0.147[sec]
Rms change [sec]: -0.153 (before/after 0.502/0.349)
Neighbours=80 Used Phases: P=37 S=16
Stations distance [km]: min=15.9 median=57.0 max=99.8
Neighbours mean distace to centroid [km]: location=5.11 depth=5.06
Origin distace to neighbours centroid [km]: location=1.30 depth=3.01
DD observations: 687 (CC P/S 141/47 TT P/S 375/124)
DD observations residuals [msec]: before=-106+/-21.6 after=9+/-26.2
```

To allow a comparison of the RMS before and after the relocation `scrtdd` computes the RMS before and after the relocation. Without that it would be hard to compare the RMSs. Each locator (scautoloc, scanloc, screloc, nonlinloc, scrtdd, etc) computes the RMS with a certain travel time table, that might not be the same as `scrtdd`. Moreover, a locator might apply a specific logic on the RMS computation that prevents a comparison between different locators. For example NonLinLoc locator weighs the residuals by each pick weight and the wighting scheme is decided by NonLinLoc.

The following two lines can be a little cryptic to interpret: 
```
Neighbours mean distace to centroid [km]: location=5.11 depth=5.06
Origin distace to neighbours centroid [km]: location=1.30 depth=3.01
```

Their intent is to highlight how far the relocated event is to the neighbours centroid. The idea is that an event that falls within a cluster has a better chance to be properly relocated than an event that is far away from the neighbouring events.

The above information is also stored in the output files (events.csv,phases.csv,station,csv) of the multi-event relocation and it can be used to compute useful statistics for an entire catalog. Those are the column names containing the information:

```
startRms
locChange
depthChange
timeChange

neigh_meanDistToCentroid
neigh_centroidToEventDist
neigh_meanDepthDistToCentroid
neigh_centroidToEventDepthDist

```

## 7. Custom velocity models

### 7.1 LOCSAT

In the `scrtdd` configuration it is possible to select any travel time table installed in SeisComP; this means the default SeisComP travel time tables and any other tables installed by the user. Although, this is a general SeisComP topic and we suggest to refer to the official SeisComP documentation, here is a quick recipe for generating your own travel time table from a custom velocity model.

SeisComP supports `LOCSAT` and `libtau` travel time table formats (1D velocity model). It is possible to generate a custom travel time table in `LOCSAT` format using the [TauP toolkit](https://www.seis.sc.edu/taup). 

First step is to have a velocity model in one of the formats supported by `TauP`. To do so, just make a copy of the SeisComP iasp91 or ak135 velocity models:

```
cp seiscomp_installation/share/ttt/iasp91.tvel mymodel.tvel
```
or
```
cp seiscomp_installation/share/ttt/ak135.tvel mymodel.tvel
```

Then edit the relevant layers to match your velocity model and leave the others untouched. Now run:

```
./TauP-installation/bin/taup_create -tvel mymodel.tvel --verbose
```

That generates `mymodel.taup` file that will be used by the subsequent TauP commands.

Before generating the travel time tables we need to decide the resolution (range of depths and distances). TauP uses a default range of depths and distances that is not very dense. So create a header file containing the desired depths and distances ranges. E.g. file `mymodel.header`

```
n # P,S travel-time tables resolution for mymodel
30     # number of depth samples
   0.00   0.50   1.00   1.50   2.50   3.00   3.50   4.00   4.50   5.00
   6.00   7.00   8.00   9.00  10.00  15.00  20.00  25.00  30.00  40.00
  50.00  75.00 100.00 150.00 200.00 300.00 400.00 500.00 600.00 800.00
130    # number of distances
   0.00   0.05   0.10   0.15   0.20   0.25   0.30   0.35   0.40   0.45
   0.50   0.60   0.70   0.80   0.90   1.00   1.10   1.20   1.30   1.40
   1.50   1.60   1.70   1.80   1.90   2.00   2.50   3.00   4.00   5.00
   5.50   6.00   6.50   7.00   7.50   8.00   8.50   9.00   9.50  10.00
  11.00  12.00  13.00  14.00  15.00  16.00  17.00  18.00  19.00  20.00
  21.00  22.00  23.00  24.00  25.00  26.00  27.00  28.00  29.00  30.00
  31.00  32.00  33.00  34.00  35.00  36.00  37.00  38.00  39.00  40.00
  41.00  42.00  43.00  44.00  45.00  46.00  47.00  48.00  49.00  50.00
  51.00  52.00  53.00  54.00  55.00  56.00  57.00  58.00  59.00  60.00
  61.00  62.00  63.00  64.00  65.00  66.00  67.00  68.00  69.00  70.00
  71.00  72.00  73.00  74.00  75.00  76.00  77.00  78.00  79.00  80.00
  81.00  82.00  83.00  84.00  85.00  86.00  87.00  88.00  89.00  90.00

```

Finally, we can generate the travel time tables:

```

./TauP-installation/bin/taup_table -mod mymodel -ph ScP  -locsat -header mymodel.header -o mymodel.ScP
./TauP-installation/bin/taup_table -mod mymodel -ph Sg   -locsat -header mymodel.header -o mymodel.Sg
./TauP-installation/bin/taup_table -mod mymodel -ph Sn   -locsat -header mymodel.header -o mymodel.Sn
./TauP-installation/bin/taup_table -mod mymodel -ph sP   -locsat -header mymodel.header -o mymodel.sP
```

Last step is to copy the travel time tables to the SeisComP installation folder so that all modules can see the new model:

```
cp mymodel* seiscomp_installation/share/locsat/tables/
```

### 7.2 NonLinLoc

Please refer to [NonLinLoc by Anthony Lomax](<http://alomax.free.fr/nlloc/>) documentation on how to generate grid files. Once you have them you can configure in `scrtdd` in travel time table options.

The following geographic transformations (TRANS statement) are currently supported: GLOBAL 2D, SIMPLE 2D and 3D, SDS 2D and 3D. Also, both float and double values are supported as well as byte swapping.

## 8. Scolv Locator plugin

A (re)locator plugin is also available in the code, which makes `scrtdd` available via `scolv`. To enable this plugin just add `rtddloc` to the list of plugins in the global configuration.

![Locator plugin](/data/img/locator-plugin.png?raw=true "Locator plugin")

Please note that this plugin is not strictly required since `scrtdd` would relocated any manual origins anyway (if configured to do so) and the relocated origin will appear on `scolv` as soon as ready.

Also `scolv` doesn't allow to create new picks when performing a relocation, so `scrtdd` plugin disable the cross-correlation on theoretical picks since those picks will not be reported on `scolv`.
